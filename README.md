# DT Money ðŸ’¸

A responsive web application  (desktop and mobile) that allows controlling all financial inputs and outputs, also enabling the creation of new categories for each transaction, as well as the search for existing transactions.

#### ðŸ‘€ Details

This project was developed in Ignite of [**Rocketseat**](https://github.com/rocketseat-education) during the third module, in which the main objectives were to understand the consumption of API, how to handle with performance in React.js and accessibility.

Thus, JSON Server was used to simulate a real API, and all the logic with the API was centralized in a context for access in several components.

Additionally, React Dev Tools helped in the process of indentifying potential performance issues. So, I got to know new React hooks like `useCallback`, `useMemo`, also `memo` functions, all used for optimization, including the Use Context Selector library, which allowed selecting which context information would be observed by a component.

Moreover, to make the application more accessible, Radix UI was used, which brings components with all accessibility parts ready, but without style, giving flexibility of use, for example, modal and radio group.
